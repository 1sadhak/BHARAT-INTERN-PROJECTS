# BHARAT-INTERN-PROJECTS
The Repository contains the source code files including their dataset for 2 projects
which I worked upon during my Business Analytics Internship at Bharat Intern:
1.Employee and attrition and performance:
In this project, we need to evaluate each factor
and its relationship with attrition, for
example, the distance from home to
office, the job role impact on attrition, etc
2.Success of an upcoming movie
For this ,we need to predict the success of an
upcoming movie so that whether or not a
company should go for buying it based on
ROI. To do this, you need to come up with
a model and use the historical data of each.
